I am a Ph.D. candidate in the School of Pharmaceutical Science and Technology, Tianjin University. My scientific interests lie in bioinformatics, statistics and batch effects. My personal interests are reading, running and swimming. My current focus in the BDSE is on the batch effects correction in multi-omics data.
