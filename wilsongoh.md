I am a computational biologist with 14 years of experience. I have been a faculty member since 2014 and am currently on the education faculty track in SBS, NTU. Previously, I held an Associate Professorship in Tianjin University, China and a concurrent Visiting Professor appointment in the School of Computing, NUS. 

My most active research contribution is in the area of network-based proteomics, which involves developing statistical models using biological networks as context. This is effective in resolving idiosyncratic data problems including incomplete coverage, inconsistency, noise and technical bias. I also make contributions towards understanding batch effects and resolving confounding issues in big data analytics. I am actively seeking to increase my contributions in the area of single cell transcriptomics and next-generation sequencing. The clinical themes I am interested in are ageing, cancer and neurological disorders (schizophrenia). My current role in NTU also requires me to also take on education research roles. And I have been using this opportunity to explore alternative teaching and learning models as well as the application of data science and advanced technologies in education.
