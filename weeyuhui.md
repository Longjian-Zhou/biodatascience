### Wee Yuhui

I am a CNYang student currently on exchange in Sweden. I enjoy snacking and playing cookie run in my free time. I also enjoying coding and believe that Python is superior to R. 

My project involves finding a gold standard for network alignment algorithms and testing existing network algorithms to see if they meet that criteria.
