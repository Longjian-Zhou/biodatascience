## Welcome to the BioData Science and Education Laboratory
We are a research group comprised of bio-data scientists, computational biologists and education technologists in the School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University.

## Current projects
Our research activities may be broadly divided into two areas: bio-data science and educational technology.

**Bio-data science** is an exciting new area where the associative technologies associated with data science and relevant thinking skills are applied onto biological and health-related problems.

These may include how to resolve batch effect problems when effecting large-scale data mergers. 

We are also interested in very fine-scale problems where we concern ourselves 

five themes: 1/ Feature selection and network modeling is concerned with resolving bio-statistical issues e.g. reproducibility and accuracy in high-throughput omics platforms using networks as context; 2/ Normalization techniques, batch effects and pure statistics is concerned with resolving noise and heterogeneity issues in data prior to functional analysis; 3/ Missing protein prediction is concerned with resolving coverage and inconsistency issues in proteomics data, an important challenge as the “data holes” impedes proper analysis; 4/ Experimental design and principles is concerned with crystalizing first-principles from contemporary research into best practices for data analysis; And 5/ Applied informatics pertains to collaborative research where I apply know-how and existing capabilities garnered from my research onto specific biological problems.

Education --- I am exploring the efficacy of two alternate teaching models and how it may be of value in NTU’s context. The “informal learning” model is an experiential hobbyist-led approach where students organize themselves into small interest groups, and with the help of a faculty/student mentor, work in designed learning spaces outside the confines of the classroom. The “student-as-partner” involves the involvement of students in co-development and execution of the teaching and learning agenda; this is also a meaningful form of mentorship where student participants achieve deeper learning by placing themselves into the role of the professor.

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gohwils/biodatascience/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gohwils/biodatascience/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.
