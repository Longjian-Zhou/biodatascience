## Welcome to the BioData Science and Education Laboratory
We are a research group comprised of bio-data scientists, computational biologists and education technologists in the School of Biological Sciences, Nanyang Technological University.

## Current projects
Our research activities may be broadly divided into two areas: bio-data science and educational technology.

**Bio-data science** is an exciting new area where the associative technologies associated with data science and relevant thinking skills are applied onto biological and health-related problems.

These may include how to resolve batch effect problems when effecting large-scale data mergers. 

We are also interested in very fine-scale problems where we concern ourselves 

five themes: 1/ Feature selection and network modeling is concerned with resolving bio-statistical issues e.g. reproducibility and accuracy in high-throughput omics platforms using networks as context; 2/ Normalization techniques, batch effects and pure statistics is concerned with resolving noise and heterogeneity issues in data prior to functional analysis; 3/ Missing protein prediction is concerned with resolving coverage and inconsistency issues in proteomics data, an important challenge as the “data holes” impedes proper analysis; 4/ Experimental design and principles is concerned with crystalizing first-principles from contemporary research into best practices for data analysis; And 5/ Applied informatics pertains to collaborative research where I apply know-how and existing capabilities garnered from my research onto specific biological problems.

Education --- I am exploring the efficacy of two alternate teaching models and how it may be of value in NTU’s context. The “informal learning” model is an experiential hobbyist-led approach where students organize themselves into small interest groups, and with the help of a faculty/student mentor, work in designed learning spaces outside the confines of the classroom. The “student-as-partner” involves the involvement of students in co-development and execution of the teaching and learning agenda; this is also a meaningful form of mentorship where student participants achieve deeper learning by placing themselves into the role of the professor.

Link out below to find out more about each area and our work/contributions

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/gohwils/biodatascience/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/gohwils/biodatascience/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### Support or Contact

Having trouble with Pages? Check out our [documentation](https://help.github.com/categories/github-pages-basics/) or [contact support](https://github.com/contact) and we’ll help you sort it out.
